I was looking through the pictures in my phone today when I found this:

I did that gig back in July 2015, and it was one of my worst gigs in the UK ever. Holy
shit. I usually don't judge posters for comedy shows but I remember when I saw this
poster for the first time (posted next to the venue's bathroom) I felt my heart just sink.
Justifiably so, because a few moments later I was up on stage bombing my ass off.

How do you even design this on purpose?? Like someone just sat in front of a computer
and was like, "how do I create an abomination?". This shit looked like it was made back when Microsoft 
Word still had that paper clip talking to you.

I have since done a few more working men's club gigs, and some of them have been great fun.
But oh boy, was that an introduction to the UK comedy circuit.
