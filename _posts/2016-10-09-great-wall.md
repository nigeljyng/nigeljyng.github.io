Recently wrote a bit about that new Great Wall movie that's coming out.

I first heard of this movie through another comic at a gig and remembered thinking
to myself, "well _that's_ ridiculous". And after checking out that trailer, I realise
that it is indeed ridiculous enough for me to make fun of on stage, and it has since
developed into one of my favourite bits to do. 

My wife was nice enough to overlay the audio of the bit on top of the trailer, check it out!
