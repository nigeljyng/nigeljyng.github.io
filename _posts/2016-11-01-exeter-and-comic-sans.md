title: Exeter and Comic Sans

I started writing this from the only trendy coffee shop in Exeter, the [exploding
bakery](http://explodingbakery.com/), inconveniently located next to the station I wasn't departing from.
I came here on the recommendation of Ronnette, the owner of the bed and
breakfast I stayed at.

"Oh you'll find some good comedy there", she said, "that place is quite hipster.
I tried ordering my coffee with sugar once and they just wouldn't let me!"

In Exeter I noticed real heavy use of comic sans everywhere (not in the Exploding Bakery of course).
However, I didn't feel the sense of repulsion that often accompanies it. In this town there seems to be something
charming about it. When I saw comic sans in Exeter, I didn't think ewww, get that design
out of my face! It felt more like travelling back to the simpler times.
Times when comic sans is still considered fun and not uncool, a font used by people who wanted to convey
friendliness. "Come to my yard sale!" it would say, or, "Ice cold lemonade, 50p!"
Comic sans is an abomination in readability, kerning, and any general guideline for
typographical design, but you could say the same applies to handwritten
words, which was what comic sans was trying to emulate in the first place.

*comic sans!*

*more comic sans!*

The day I got there, there was a [huge fire](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-37821908)
that burned down a beloved old hotel building.
During dinner, I asked the waitress at the restaurant about it.

"Yeah what I last heard was they were trying to get water from the river," was her
response, "and we were told not to do laundry in case the fire brigade needed more water."

I had a feeling nobody did laundry that day, "Wear your clothes for another
day, son! This city needs us!" The city is so small that any loss of any building
represented a loss in the fabric of their daily lives. This is not London, where if a fire
razed a building into the ground, all people would do is read about it in the
Evening Standard during their commute and go, "Glad that's not MY neighbourhood."

On the day I left Exeter, I could still see gray smoke rising into the skies.
