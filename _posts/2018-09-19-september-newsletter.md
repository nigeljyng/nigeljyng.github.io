Hello folks! I’ve had a fair few people sign up to the list during my Edinburgh Fringe run so if you just joined recently, thanks for coming to see me at Edinburgh and welcome to the list! Edinburgh was really fun. Was great to see so many Asians coming down to watch the show, never knew there were so many Malaysians in Edinburgh! If you want to catch me live some time, I travel all over the UK and have my gig list up at [my site](http://nigelngcomedy.com/#gigs).

I have some EXCITING news! I'll be on Comedy Central's Standup Central on October 10th. It's my first TV appearance ever so I'm pretty excited for it to come out. Remember to tune in! Or, more likely, remember to click on the URL that I’ll be posting on all the social media channels. It’s going to be a good one!

The Asian world (ok, more like just on twitter) is all abuzz right now with the movie [Crazy Rich Asians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/). And I just saw it a few hours ago! Oh man, it was pretty boooring! I guess it’s pretty cool to see a cast of all Asians in a movie, where none of them know kung fu (finally!). But on the other hand it was just a mediocre romantic comedy. It was just rich people doing rich people shit. The whole movie felt like a 2 hour long Singapore tourism ad. 

Remember the Rush Hour franchise? Back then no studio PR team was going look at the diversity in this movie. A black guy and a Chinese man working together! Look at the diversity! See how inclusive we are! Shanghai Noon! Chinese guy and Owen Wilson in cowboy hats! Look at the representation.

Yeah it’s a movie about Asians, but they’re not portraying regular Asians either. These are like cartoonishly rich Asians. The movie opens with the mum character getting annoyed at a hotel for not honouring her reservation. She calls her husband, and the husband BUYS THE HOTEL! Oh wow, that’s SUPER relatable. Totally what normal Asian people do. I’ve never been at a Pizza Hut, “Oh you put pineapple on my pizza? I own this place now. Go mop the floor.” If you changed the race of the people in the film, it wouldn’t fly at all. Could you imagine if they made a film called Crazy Rich White People? People would be outraged! Why are we celebrating the 1% in these times? Millenials are struggling to get by because avocado toast is too expensive! 

Also, there’s always been lots of Asians in movies, they’re called foreign films, but nobody seems to give a shit about those. But with Crazy Rich Asians it’s like people went, “Finally, a movie with Asians but with no subtitles! Asians who only speak English! I can get behind that!”

I've never gotten why subtitles are so hated. Growing up in Malaysia most of the movies I watched had subtitles. Multilingual ones even. Every piece of dialogue has 3 lines of text, one for each language. I think still got the gist of movies! I watched Titanic with trilingual subtitles when I was a kid, and I definitely remember the main plot points - Kate Winslet getting drawn in the nude and something about an iceberg. You never forget the first movie boobs you saw. I was still a child and found it hysterical. Look!! Boooobies! Eww…

I think if subtitles are able to distract you from the film, that’s a SHIT FILM then! There are sounds, images, plots, characters but you’re distracted by a bunch of white text? On the bottom edge of the screen? How boring is that movie? 

Anyways, be sure to keep an eye out for the Comedy Central clip I’ll be sharing soon! And skip Crazy Rich Asians. Well if you really want to support our people, buy a ticket, but don’t go watch it. Or do the proper Asian thing and just pirate it. That’s what a Normal, Regular Financial Means Asian wold do.
