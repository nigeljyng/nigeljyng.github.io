Hello newsletter people and also new joiners to my list!

I spent the whole month of August up in Edinburgh this year, doing the [Pleasance Comedy Reserve](https://www.pleasance.co.uk/content/charlie-hartill-special-reserve) at the Edinburgh fringe. It was my first time up at an arts festival – what a foreign concept! So. Many. Acapella. Groups. Why are they always so happy? Just snapping their fingers, smiling while singing. Why are you so happy man? Is it because you don’t use instruments? Is it because you found a group of people to do this weird thing with you? Stop it already with that shoo waap shoo waap thing. I’ve been to a few acapella shows during my time at uni, and that’s youth I’ll never get back.

I stayed in a flat with fellow showcase comics, one of whom was Danny from Dudley. The first day we met I introduced him to fish sauce at a Thai place and I think it blew his mind a bit. “Who knew you could make a sauce from fish? What is this? Fish sweat? Liquid fish? I’m from Dudley, if it ain’t HP, it ain’t a sauce!” Which was made even funnier because of his midlands accent that tilts up at the end of sentences. And a few days later we had kimchi, which he equally did not enjoy. “Pickled cabbage, man? I don’t even like regular cabbage! What is this shit?” Looking back now I think fish sauce and kimchi might have been a little over-adventurous. Should have eased him into it with ramen/Pad Thai/dumplings. Lesson learned. Hope he gives those a try in the future. I also tried a tattie scone for the first time. Just felt like a Scottish samosa to me.

As with most festivals where young people with disposable income congregate, the fringe had street food everywhere. A Westernised version of it. Clean, nicely packaged street food that promises not to give you diarrhoea afterwards. I love street food. I grew up on it. It’s the common man’s food in Malaysia. But holy shit the street food here is all hip and cool and instagram-worthy. I saw a food truck selling creme brulee. CREME BRULEE! That’s not the spirit of street food! No Malaysian kid’s walking around going, “I could really do with a French burnt custard right now. Ooh look he torches it right in front of us!” (I can’t even type out the accent marks in brulee. If your food has accent marks in its name then that’s not street food. That’s posh restaurant food, just served from the back of a van.)

I went to a museum up here and saw two babies that looked like they’ve been through a lot. Who knew the renaissance was a tough time for infants.

Real happy to be back home. Come check out a show and say hi if you get a chance! I got some new bits about sleeper trains and passing my driving test in Malaysia by bribing.
