Hello newsletter people! (I’m going to do a bit of Edinburgh promo up top and then talk about random stuff after.)

I’m doing my show Malaysian Sensation up at the Edinburgh Fringe - it’s a show about Malaysia, and shit white people do wrong in the UK (like buying sushi from Boots). If you’ve seen me before, it’ll have some of the bits you’ve heard, but probably improved and honed and sharpened up a bit. And yes I will be bringing my newly bought [Zojirushi rice cooker](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkruuiiA1h9/), like every proper Asian would. Doing Edinburgh is hard enough. I’m not going to make it worst by having to endure Uncle Ben’s instant rice for a month. 

7.10pm at City Cafe. For the whole of the Fringe (2-26 August except Wednesdays). It’s a free show, with a bucket collection at the end. Here’s the link to it: [https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/nigel-ng-malaysian-sensation-work-in-progress](https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/nigel-ng-malaysian-sensation-work-in-progress)

Since I last wrote I also recorded my first ever TV set for Comedy Central! Super exciting! I sent my mum a pic of me on stage and she just told me that I looked fat. And that [tweet](https://twitter.com/MrNigelNg/status/996456564658667520) is now the most liked tweet I’ve got. Thanks, mum. The show’s going to air in the autumn sometime and I’ll make sure to keep you guys posted on that.

I’ve been doing a fair bit of driving on motorways in the UK, and I think this country has a gambling problem. Every UK motorway rest stop has a casino in it. With slot machines and everything. It usually looks like this:

Who’s gambling on the middle of the M4? Is there someone on the road, narrowly avoiding an accident, “Oh shit that was close, I almost hit that truck. Man I must have a hot hand right now! Let me hit up the fruit machine in this rest stop. If I win I’ll buy everything from the WH Smith!” Cause what are you going to spend your lottery winnings on at a rest stop? And the worst thing is, that’s usually the only thing that’s open 24 hours at the rest stop! As someone who drives late on a motorway sometimes, I’d much rather they have a Burger King open. Because with Burger King, you know it’s not a gamble - you’ll always get diarrhoea. 

In other news, I’ve been trying to find a good Thai massage place in London recently. I’ve had a few really good ones in Asia but it’s really hard to find a non-sketchy massage place in London. Because they all look kinda seedy. Dingy decor. Those neon signs that say “open” have got to go. There seems to be something about pursuing a massage therapist career that makes you hate interior decorating. Here’s an idea: why don’t we get hipsters to rebrand Thai massages? Do to massage parlours what trendy artistic types did to coffee shops. Have some exposed brick walls. Organic massage oils. Gluten free bread while you wait. Vinyl records spinning in the corner. You’re not gonna ask for a happy ending if your masseuse has a handlebar moustache. If you do, they’ll be as condescending to you as if you asked for (gasp) sugar in your drip coffee. “Er sir, we feel the happy ending overpowers the nuances of the massage. At this massage facility we strongly encourage customers to actually experience the sensations of a massage.”

I think having electronic massage chairs would be nice too. We had those everywhere in Asia. You pop a coin in, and off it goes. I remember killing hours at Seoul Incheon airport getting kneaded by a chair. Why aren’t there any of those here in the UK? Those chairs would be quite nice actually. They’re usually placed out in the open in the middle of a mall or an airport, so we know nobody’s getting a happy ending there. One because everybody can see you, and two because the chair will just crush anything you put in its way.

Anyways, do come to my show in Edinburgh if you venture up there. Would be nice to see some familiar faces! I hear the venue now even has newly installed air-conditioning. AND the rest of the year it’s a karaoke room. What more can I want?
